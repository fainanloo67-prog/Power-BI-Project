## 🏥 Healthcare Analytics – Hospital Performance & Cost Analysis (USA)

This project is an end-to-end Power BI healthcare analytics solution designed to analyze hospital performance, discharge patterns, length of stay (LOS), and cost efficiency across hospitals in the United States.  
The report supports both executive-level monitoring and hospital-level deep-dive analysis through interactive visuals and drill-through capabilities.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Analyze hospital discharges, admissions, LOS, and costs across multiple regions  
- Identify key drivers behind high LOS and high cost per discharge  
- Compare hospitals and service areas to uncover inefficiencies  
- Enable hospital-level performance profiling via drill-through pages  
- Support data-driven decision-making for healthcare administrators

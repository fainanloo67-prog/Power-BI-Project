# Healthcare Analytics (USA)

This project is an end-to-end Power BI healthcare analytics solution designed to analyze hospital performance, discharge patterns, length of stay (LOS), and cost efficiency across hospitals in the United States.  
The report supports both executive-level monitoring and hospital-level deep-dive analysis through interactive visuals and drill-through capabilities.

## Project Objectives

- Analyze hospital discharges, admissions, LOS, and costs across multiple regions  
- Identify key drivers behind high LOS and high cost per discharge  
- Compare hospitals and service areas to uncover inefficiencies  
- Enable hospital-level performance profiling via drill-through pages  
- Support data-driven decision-making for healthcare administrators

## Analytical Techniques

### Advanced DAX & Data Modeling
- Extensive use of `SUMMARIZE` and `SUMMARIZECOLUMNS` to create analytical summary tables  
- Custom calculated tables and measures for KPIs and comparisons  

### Key Influencers Visual
- Used to identify factors that increase Average LOS  
- Highlighted drivers behind higher cost per discharge  

### Drill Through Analysis
- Drill through from hospital lists to a dedicated hospital profile page  
- Enables in-depth investigation for each facility  

### Measure-Driven Design
- KPIs, benchmarks, and comparisons fully driven by DAX measures  

### Interactive Slicers
- Year, hospital service area, and facility filters  
- Applied consistently across all report pages  

## Tools & Technologies

- DAX (Advanced Measures & Summary Tables)  
- Power BI Key Influencers Visual  
- Drill Through & Cross-Filtering  
- Custom Interactive Dashboards
